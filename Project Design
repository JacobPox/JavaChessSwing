#This is where the details to the design go.

"The Project 1 design should have the following:

The classes that you know of now. Obviously we may add more or edit what we have, but this will be a good estimate on what you will be doing.  If there is a connection (inheritance), make sure to show/state that.

In each class, try to give a rough idea of the information you will be storing and possible functions.  You don't have to go into a large amount of detail here.  Just need the top view look at what you think you will need.

Since Project 1 is only text based input, how do you think the interaction will work.  What type of stuff does the user have to do or select. Some of the ideas might be better suited for the Graphical User Interface (GUI), so how will you simulate the interactions for Project 1?

Last part will be stating any rules that will need to be addressed. If there is something that you have to assume, state that. Most of this will go into your back-end code."

/*

I thought we could have a base abstract class called ChessPiece that would have:

variables:
'position' a 2d vector stored in an arrayList that holds the piece's xy position on the grid and 

-'inPlay' a boolean value that tells you if a piece has been taken

methods:
-'move' a wrapper function that has information about piece specific movement ()
-'add' adds the current position vector with potential moves to return possible final positions.
-'askOpen' void, asks the board
-'tellOpen' boolean, tells the board that the piece is there. Informs board iff the piece moves or 'inPlay' turns false
-'takePiece' informs another object that their 'inPlay' value should be changed to false
-'setInPlay' changes inPlay to false and informs the board that there is no longer a piece at that position

class ChessBoard
variables:
-'board' a 2d array of all possible positions and each position holds the value of the player
(because which piece it is wont matter to this logic, just that its there so that objects can know
if they cant move there because their piece is there, or if they can take the other player's piece)

methods:
-'getPosition' returns a string of which player is at that location if any player is there

Jacob's Thoughts:

Classes:
Board
ValidateMove (to make sure the move is allowed)
King
Queen
Knight
Bishop
Rook
Pawn
Screen

For the pieces and their respective classes, validatemove can be used to check each pattern (king can only move one at a time, queen can go horizontal/veritcal/diagonal as far as she wants).

The board will hold information of where all the pieces are and represent the 8x8 board.

The screen will generate something to be seen based on the board class (or this could be combined, I don’t know yet)

ValidateMove will check many things. It needs to have information of how each piece is allowed to move, check to see if the move goes off the board, and also make sure that you can’t put yourself in check.

Even with text based input, you could use algebraic notation to make a move that is commonly used in chess already.

Some specific cases that have to be considered:

Pawns can move 2 times if it is their first move. 
En passant is a very specific case with pawns and how they can attack
Castling has a few rules in order to be done such as no piece in between the king and rook being in check and neither pieces have moved.
Many others, since chess largely is a game of rules.
